# Main Purpose of the Lab

The purpose of this lab is to practice continuous testing through a real example using a Node.js User API.
The lab focuses on test-driven development (TDD) by implementing the GET user functionality.
This includes writing unit tests, API tests, and implementing the corresponding controller and route to retrieve user information from the Redis database.

# Possible Uses in a Company

The concepts used in this lab are directly applicable in professional environments:
	•	Implementing backend services using REST APIs
	•	Building reliable applications with automated tests
	•	Ensuring software quality through TDD
	•	Using Redis as a fast in-memory data store
	•	Structuring a Node.js project with reusable controllers and routes
	•	Supporting CI/CD pipelines where tests must run automatically before deployment

# Step in the DevOps Cycle

This lab belongs to the Continuous Testing phase of the DevOps cycle.
It contributes to:
	•	Build: structuring code into controllers, routes, and services
	•	Test: writing and executing automated tests (unit + API)
	•	Release: ensuring code is reliable before deployment
	•	Continuous Improvement: adopting TDD practices for safer development
