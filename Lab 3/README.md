#Main Purpose of the Lab

The goal of this lab is to learn and practice the fundamental concepts of Git and GitHub.
It covers repository creation, cloning, branching, committing changes, pushing to a remote repository, and resolving merge conflicts.

#Possible Uses in a Company

Git is one of the most widely used version control systems in the industry.
The skills developed in this lab directly apply to real company environments:
	•	Collaborative development: multiple developers can work simultaneously on the same project.
	•	Code history tracking: all changes can be reviewed, reverted, or audited.
	•	Branch-based workflows: teams can isolate features, experiments, or bug fixes.
	•	Conflict management: understanding how to detect and resolve merge conflicts is essential in any development team.
	•	Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Git repositories serve as the foundation for automated pipelines.
	•	Documentation and transparency: each commit contributes to traceability and project governance.

#Step in the DevOps Cycle

This lab fits primarily into the Source Code Management (SCM) phase of the DevOps cycle.
More specifically, it contributes to:
	•	Plan: structuring work through branches.
	•	Code: modifying and updating code collaboratively.
	•	Build / Test: enabling automated processes thanks to version-controlled code.
	•	Release / Deploy: Git is the entry point of most CI/CD pipelines.
	•	Monitor / Improve: traceability helps future debugging and improvement.

Git is therefore a core tool for ensuring efficient collaboration and continuous delivery in DevOps environments.
